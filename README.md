This is a web app to help with doing color work with jelly cubes. It can render up to a 10x10 and supports all 3 styles of jelly cube.
Fair warning, rendering a 10x10 takes my PC about 5 seconds and adds a persistent 15% CPU load while the app window is open, and I have a high-end development/gaming machine so it may be too intense for your PC.

Features:

- Functions for saving/importing your colored cube data
- The green slider bars adjust visibility on each of the layers to allow you to access the inner layers of the cube. The Show All Rings button will reset the visibility sliders so all rings are displayed again.
- Color Selection Interface. Up to 5 colors can be preserved using the blue + button for quickly selecting between colors. (These aren't currently saved with your cube data, but I'll try to include that in a future update)
- Light and dark mode for changing your background color.
  There will eventually be a function that splits the cube apart into layers to print off a build guide, but that's still a work in progress.

One major caveat: Please select your size and style first, as the cube regenerates from scratch and doesn't currently save any of your existing color work when you change those two parameters. This will be adjusted in a future update.
